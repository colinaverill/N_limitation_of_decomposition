1. CUE and NUE become functions of C:N stoichiometry of substrate based on Mooshammer.
2. immobilization has non-linear uptake kinetics such that inorganic N can still exist under N limitation (Just like DOC does).
3. POM needs to go into MAOM at some rate- what rate?
4. N taken up first from POM then from inorganic N. Inorganic N needs a loss rate.
