1. Get confident in C-only model parameter choices, try to keep Experiment 1 figure looking similar. 
2. immobilization has non-linear uptake kinetics such that inorganic N can still exist under N limitation (Just like DOC does).
3. Inorganic N needs a loss rate.
4. CUE and NUE become functions of C:N stoichiometry of substrate based on Mooshammer.
